# Use case manager

This project is a test to create a project from scratch. 
The idea is to illustrate all questions and answers that can happen from the ground to build a project, without any particular knowledge.

The functional objective of this project is to implement a tool to help designing use cases as suggested by Alister Cockburn in his book "Effective Use Cases"
